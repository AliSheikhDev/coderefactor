### What Makes It Amazing:
        The code is now more organized and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (S in SOLID).
        Dependencies are injected through the constructor, following Dependency Injection (D in SOLID).
        
###    What Makes It Okay:
        The use of the response helper directly might be okay, but consider using Laravel's response macros for consistency and reusability.
        Enhancing the code with more detailed comments within the methods, particularly for intricate logic or where business rules are applied, is beneficial. A preferred approach is to provide summary comments before each method.

###    What Makes It Terrible:
        The use of env() directly in conditions might be okay but consider extracting it to a variable for better readability.
        The code violates SOLID principles by incorporating multiple modules within a single class and lacks proper code readability.
